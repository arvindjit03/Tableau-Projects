In this project, we are performing ETL using Tableau on Sales data and for database operations, we are using MySQL.

- We have created our data model in Tableau and performed Data cleaning.
- After cleaning the data, we loaded it into Tableau and created various worksheets using  different visualizations.
- At last, we added all the worksheets and built an interactive dashboard that shows all the insights for the sales of different products and customers.
