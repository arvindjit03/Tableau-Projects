In this project, we are performing ETL using Tableau on Sales data and for database operations, we are using MySQL.

- We have created our data model in Tableau and performed Data cleaning.
- After cleaning the data, we loaded it into Tableau and created various worksheets for our data files.
- At last, we added all the worksheets into one and created an interactive dashboard that shows all the insights for the sales of different products and customers within India.
- Here is the link to the final Sales dashboard [Sales_Insights](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arvindjit.singh/viz/Sales_Insights_17109565133920/Sales_Insights)
