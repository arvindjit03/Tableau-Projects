In this project, we have conducted ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes using Tableau on sales data. For database operations, we utilized MySQL. 

- We have developed our data model in Tableau and performed data cleaning. Following data cleaning, we loaded it into Tableau and generated various worksheets for our data files.
- At last, we added all the worksheets into one and created an interactive dashboard that shows all the insights for the sales of different products and customers within India.
- Here is the link to the final Sales dashboard: [Sales_Insights](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arvindjit.singh/viz/Sales_Insights_17109565133920/Sales_Insights)
